# Basic Twitter Sentiment Analytics using Apache Spark

## Streaming APIs and Python

In this project, we will be processing streaming data in real time. One of the first requirements is to get
access to the streaming data; in this case, tweets. We will be simulating real-time streaming of tweets
so that we have a consistent dataset.

In addition, we will also be using Kafka to buffer the tweets before processing. Kafka provides a
distributed queuing service which can be used to store the data when the data creation rate is more
than processing rate.

## How to Run

Download and extract the twitter data zip file:

Download the 16M.txt.zip file from here :

unzip 16M.txt.zip

### Start zookeeper service:

`$KAFKA_HOME/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/zookeeper.properties`

### Start kafka service:

`$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/server.properties`


Create a topic named twitterstream in kafka:

`$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost: 2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic twitterstream`

### Check what topics we have with:

`$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost: 2181`

### Using the Streaming API

In order to stream the tweets and push them to kafka queue, we have provided a python script
twitter_to_kafka.py.

To stream tweets, we will read tweets from a file and push them to the twitterstream topic in Kafka. Do this by running our program as follows:

`$ python twitter_to_kafka.py`

Note, this program must be running when you run your portion of the assignment, otherwise you will not
get any tweets.

To check if the data is landing in Kafka:

`$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost: 2181 --topic twitterstream --from-beginning`

### Running the Stream Analysis Program (after finishing the project requirements)

`$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-streaming-kafka- 0 - 8_2.11:2.0.
twitterStream.py`
